  <b>Printing Multicolor Stickers</b>
  <p>Using the Roland 560i, I printed two multicolor stickers. My first sticker was a sticker of my dog. I imported his image into adobe photoshop and copied it into corel draw. Around his head, I had to put a specific pink outline so that the printer knew where to cut. My second sticker was a picture of my uncles face. I inserted it into a circle then put the pink outline around it so it would be cut out. Next, I loaded them onto a flashdrive and printed them.</p>

  <p>Using the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1, I printed two one color stickers. My first sticker was a yellow dog and the second was a pink elephant. I used Corel draw and uploaded clipart of the dog and elephant. I then printed them.</p>
