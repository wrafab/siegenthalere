  <b>Printing Multicolor Stickers</b>
  <p>Using the Roland 560i, I printed two multicolor stickers. My first sticker was a sticker of my dog. I imported his image into adobe photoshop and copied it into corel draw. Around his head, I had to put a specific pink outline so that the printer knew where to cut. My second sticker was a picture of my uncles face. I inserted it into a circle then put the pink outline around it so it would be cut out. Next, I loaded them onto a flashdrive and printed them.</p>

  <p>Using the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1, I printed two one color stickers. My first sticker was a yellow dog and the second was a pink elephant. I used Corel draw and uploaded clipart of the dog and elephant. I then printed them.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Why did I create each sticker?</b>
    <p>I made the sticker of my dog face because I love him. I made the sticker of my uncle for my father. I made the elephant and yellow dog sticker because I like dogs and elephants.</p>
    <b>What was the thought process while I was creating my notebook?</b>
    <p>I put the stickers on my laptop instead of a notebook. My thought process was that I wanted to have quality stickers on my laptop.</p>
    <b>What was the most challenging part of this process?</b>
    <p>The most challenging part was getting the pink boarder around the images.</p>
    <b>What did you learn in the process?</b>
    <p>I learned how to insert images into shapes and make stickers.</p>

    <b>Molding From a Negative</b>
    <p>To make my wax mold, got an image that said "Believe and turned it into a 3D image on Selva 3D. The wax was then milled out in the MDX40A. Now, my wax mold can be used as a chocolate mold.</p>

    <b>Molding and Casting Pewter</b>
    <p>For this assignment, I made an Indians pendant. First, using Corel Draw, I made my wooden molds. Using the Laser cutter, I engraved the top wooden block with a simple circle. On the middle wood block, I cut a hole so I could pore the pewter in. The bottom block had the Cleveland Indians logo on it. After I made the wooden molds, I clamped them together and was able to pored in baby powder, so the pewter would not stick and then the pewter. When the pewter cooled, I took it out of the mold and cut off the top excess pewter, buffed it out, and drilled a hole in the top. </p>
