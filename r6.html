  <b>Printing Multicolor Stickers</b>
  <p>Using the Roland 560i, I printed two multicolor stickers. My first sticker was a sticker of my dog. I imported his image into adobe photoshop and copied it into corel draw. Around his head, I had to put a specific pink outline so that the printer knew where to cut. Next, I loaded it onto a flashdrive and printed it.</p>
