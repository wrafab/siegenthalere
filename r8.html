  <b>Soldering and Electronics</b>
  <p>Through this assignment I learned that soldering is used to connect wires to boards so electricity can flow through. To solder, I put the necessary components on the board, then joined them by melting solder on them. My project did not work, possibly because a part of the metal was not touching the board.</p>
