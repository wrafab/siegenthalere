  <b>Skateboard Making Process</b>
  <p>Step 1: Take the separate pieces of wood and glue them together with Titebond III glue. With a partner, use a roller to quickly put the glue on the separate boards and stack them ontop of each other.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Step 2: Put the boards in a vacuum bag with a skateboard mold. Make sure the netting is spread out and by the pump. Seal the vacuum bag with tar and pump all the air out.</p>
  <p>Step 3: Design a vinale decal for the bottom of the board. Using Corel Draw I put images of my brother's favorite basketball players. I printed out the decal and stuck it to the board.</p>
