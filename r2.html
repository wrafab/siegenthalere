  <p>For this project, I made a wax stamp with the name of my house on it. First, using Fusion 360, I designed my stamp. Next, I put text in and extruded and reversed the text so it would look normal when stamped. To get my design to the 3D priter, I put the file on a flash drive then plugged the flash drive into the printer. My stanp took about two hours to print and it turned out really well!</p>
