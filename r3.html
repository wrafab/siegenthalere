  <b>Brother GT-361</b>
  <p>Using the Brother GT-361, I was able to make a T-shirt. To make the design for the t-shirt, I used Adobe Photoshop to cut out a picture of Tom Brady, I then copied the picture to Corel Draw and typed above Tom Brady. I saved the final design as a jpg downloaded it onto a flash drive. Next, I grabbed a blank t-shirt and heated it so it would be flat. I then put the shirt into theBrotherGT-361 and plug my flashdrive in. My t-shirt came out with my design on it.
